A Data science project to build a real estate price prediction website, by creating a model using sklearn and linear regression using Bangalore house prices dataset from kaggle.com. Writing a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests and constructing the website using HTML, CSS and Javascript that allows user to enter home square feet area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms to retrieve the predicted price. The Project uses concepts such as data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier detection and removal, dimensionality reduction and gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning,
